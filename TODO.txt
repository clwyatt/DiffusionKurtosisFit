* TODO Items

** the code needs a lot of cleanup and refactoring

** verify the mean kurtosis output

** add option to smooth inputs first

** add option to save norm of fit residual for each voxel

** add mask input to specify what region to performs fits
*** requires a default value be used in nonmask locations (problematic)

** look into threading the computation and/or using MPI
** each fit take from to ? to 800 ms

** seperate code to dump nrrd header and data into different formats or reuse unu join
*** use a file format that allows streaming in ITK
*** according to this page only Meta Image fully supports streaming
