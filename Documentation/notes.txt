eddy current and motion correction using FSL, AFNI, or DTIprep
nonlinear least squares using vnl

D = 6 parameters
K = 15 parameters

S_0 is either a free parameter or the average B0 image.

Total of 21 (or 22) parameters.

See Equations 1 and 2 of Zhuo 2012 paper.

"Diffusion weighted (DW) images from individual averages were
corrected first for motion artifacts using the 3dvolreg command in
AFNI. The 2 averages of motion
corrected DW images were then averaged and spatially smoothed using a
Gaussian filter with a FWHM of 0.3 mm to increase the signalâ€“noise
ratio (SNR). DW signals from all three b-values (b = 0, 1000, 2000
s/mm2) and 30 directions were then fitted voxel-wise using non-linear
least squares fit to the equation:"
