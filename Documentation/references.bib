abstract = {This article presents two related advancements to the diffusional kurtosis imaging estimation framework to increase its robustness to noise, motion, and imaging artifacts. The first advancement substantially improves the estimation of diffusion and kurtosis tensors parameterizing the diffusional kurtosis imaging model. Rather than utilizing conventional unconstrained least squares methods, the tensor estimation problem is formulated as linearly constrained linear least squares, where the constraints ensure physically and/or biologically plausible tensor estimates. The exact solution to the constrained problem is found via convex quadratic programming methods or, alternatively, an approximate solution is determined through a fast heuristic algorithm. The computationally more demanding quadratic programming-based method is more flexible, allowing for an arbitrary number of diffusion weightings and different gradient sets for each diffusion weighting. The heuristic algorithm is suitable for real-time settings such as on clinical scanners, where run time is crucial. The advantage offered by the proposed constrained algorithms is demonstrated using in vivo human brain images. The proposed constrained methods allow for shorter scan times and/or higher spatial resolution for a given fidelity of the diffusional kurtosis imaging parametric maps. The second advancement increases the efficiency and accuracy of the estimation of mean and radial kurtoses by applying exact closed-form formulae.},

@article{Jensen2005,
abstract = {A magnetic resonance imaging method is presented for quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter, reflecting the structural differences between these two types of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},
